# Mixed Messages
### Codecademy Portfolio Project

##### Project Specification

>**For this project**, you will build a message generator program. Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output. Youâ€™re welcome to take the project in a couple of different forms, like an astrology generator, inspirational message, or nonsensical jokes. To make your program truly random, the message that it outputs should be made up of at least three different pieces of data. Take what you know of JavaScript syntax so far to build the program and customize it to your liking.

>######Project Objectives:
    +Build a message generator program using JavaScript
    +Use Git version control
    +Use command line
    +Develop locally on your computer

>######Prerequisites:
    +JavaScript
    +Git and GitHub
    +Command line

##### My Plan

I plan to Create a random message generator that prints a inspiring message for the day, but I also plan to add HTML, CSS and other Javascript to the app, to help display it on the web for other people to see, using some of the Responsive Web Design and interactive javascript that I've learned using Codecademy.

##### Steps:
    1. Create a script and run it locally
    2. Store Message Components
    3. Create the Message
    4. Put together the Program
    5. Create HTML Layout
    6. Apply CSS Styling
    7. Apply Interactive JavaScript Elements.
    8. Success?
